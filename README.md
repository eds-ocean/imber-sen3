### Pre-requisites

This program is intended to be used in a cloud environment e.g. JupyterHub or Github Codespaces. However, you can also run the code in your local machine.

Please make sure that your cloud or local machine can connect to global internet. For example, you cannot run it in an HPC with access only to local intranet.

In your working machine, you will need to install required modules. Conda environment's yml file is available in `Settings` directory.
